Referred to : \
[reliable transfer protocol repo on github](https://github.com/yannickzj/reliable-data-transfer-protocols) \
[Another repo](https://github.com/ROODAY/Reliable-Transport) 

* StackOverflow and GeeksForGeeks websites have been accessed to correct errors related to timer.java and checksum generation
